# CSS HTML5 JAVASCRIPT | Bubble Shooter Videogame Project 


## Introduction

This videogame is my first approach to complete a project based on Javascript HTML5 and CSS3. This project is based on the bubble shooter games, I chose it because for the player it is a very simple game but at the same time, it has a lot of complexity of the tile-matching identification.

## Achievements so far
Create random color bubbles from a bubble constructor
Create a different bubble which change attributes once is shooted
Score points
Music effects


## Unsolved functionalities

Make a hexagonal array where each bubble has 6 adjacent tiles instead of four
Identify cl√∫sters of same color bubbles and splice them all
Shoot the bubble in various directions
